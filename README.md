# lane_line_detector

This project uses the U-Net architecture originally created for medical image segmentation along with other variations of my own to tackle the problem of lane line detection for autonomous driving.
I trained the model using the CULane dataset and achieved a f-score of 96% on the Jiqing expressway dataset.
